# Vulkan Samples

This repository holds many samples, showing various aspect of Vulkan, debugging tips and usage of other Nvidia tools.

Most of the samples have for starting point, the [base_sample](base_sample) sample. They are applying a few modifications to that base sample, by deriving from it, to illustrate the modifications required to enable the feature or what need to be demonstrate.

Each sample have its own documentation written in [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) describing what was modified and where to get more information.

## Build

### Easy Method (Windows)

Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_samples.git
```

1. Deploy.bat : pull and update all dependencies.
2. Build.bat : build all projects in release and optionally to debug.
3. Install.bat : copy the binaries and dlls to the `_Install` directory.

### Hand Made

``` bash
git clone --recursive --shallow-submodules https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nvpro_core.git
git clone https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_samples.git
```

Generate solution

``` bash
cd vk_samples
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

**Note**: If there are missing dependencies in `nvpro_core`, run the following command in nvpro_core directory.

``` bash
git submodule update --init --recursive --checkout --force
```

### Extra SDK

Some samples depend on other SDKs. They are only required if you intend to build these projects.

* [OptiX 7.3+](https://developer.nvidia.com/designworks/optix/download) : OptiX denoiser
* [Cuda 10.x](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) : OptiX denoiser
* [Nsight Aftermath](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-aftermath) : Aftermath

## Samples

### [Base Sample](base_sample)

![base_sample](base_sample/docs/thumb.png)

**Extensions**:
[`VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline), [`VK_KHR_acceleration_structure`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_acceleration_structure.html), [`VK_KHR_ray_query`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_ray_query.html), [`VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations.html), [`VK_KHR_buffer_device_address`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_buffer_device_address.html)
 <br/>

This is a simple but complete Vulkan sample. It loads glTF scenes and renders using rasterizer or ray tracer. Note, at some point, the other samples were created from this one.

### [Aftermath SDK](aftermath)

**Extensions**:
[`VK_NV_device_diagnostics_config`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_NV_device_diagnostics_config.html), [`VK_NV_device_diagnostic_checkpoints`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_NV_device_diagnostic_checkpoints.html)
 <br/>
Adding Aftermath SDK to automatically generate GPU crash dump when a there is a device lost. Dumps are written before the computer crashes and can be inspected in Nsight Graphics.

### [Inherited Viewport](inherited)

![](inherited/docs/thumb.png)

**Extensions**:
[`VK_NV_inherited_viewport_scissor`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_NV_inherited_viewport_scissor.html)
 <br/>
Using the inherited extension to avoid re-generating multiple recorded command buffers for different viewport sizes.

### [Multi-Sampling Anti-Aliasing (MSAA)](msaa)

![msaa](msaa/docs/thumb.png)

Using multi-sampling anti-aliasing in efficient way for the rasterizer.

### [Shader Debug Printf](debug_printf)

![debug_printf](debug_printf/docs/thumb.png)<br/>
**Extensions**:
[`VK_KHR_shader_non_semantic_info`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_shader_non_semantic_info.html)

Adding debug printing information directly in the shader code.

### [OptiX Denoiser](optix_denoiser)

![img](optix_denoiser/docs/thumb.png)<br/>
**Extensions**: [VK_KHR_synchronization2](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_synchronization2.html), [VK_KHR_external_memory](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_external_memory.html)

Using the OptiX denoiser on the path traced image to remove residual noise.

### [HDR sampling](hdr_sampling)

![](hdr_sampling/docs/thumb.jpg)<br/>
**Extensions**:

High Dynamic Range image sampling is added to the base sample for both raster and ray trace, using multiple importance sampling acceleration structure and convoluted cubemaps.
