# GPU Monitor

![](gpu_monitor.png)

This example doesn't show any Vulkan specifics, but shows how to add the NVML element to the framework to display GPU usage. This is done by using the [NVIDIA Management Library (NVML)](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-management-library-nvml) and retrieving the information at certain intervals. This data is displayed in a window that can be docked anywhere.
