# Vulkan Ray Query Implementation

![Ray Query Visualization](docs/ray_query.png)

## Overview

This sample demonstrates the implementation of ray queries using the Vulkan ray tracing extension [VK_KHR_ray_query](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_ray_query.html), introduced in Vulkan 1.2.

## Key Concepts

- GPU-based intersection testing between rays and geometry
- Efficient ray tracing for real-time rendering and physics simulations

## Implementation Process

1. **Acceleration Structure Creation**
   - Construct bottom-level and top-level acceleration structures
   - Represents scene geometry for efficient traversal

2. **Ray Query Dispatch**
   - Specify ray origin and direction
   - Support for single or batch ray queries

3. **Query Processing**
   - GPU performs ray traversal and intersection testing
   - Utilizes acceleration structure for efficiency

4. **Result Retrieval**
   - Access intersection data (hit points, normals, distances)

## Technical Advantages

- Selective intersection testing capabilities
- Performance optimization through test skipping (e.g., shadow tests)
- Enhanced flexibility compared to traditional ray tracing pipelines

## Applications

- Real-time rendering
- Ray-based physics simulations
- Any scenario requiring accurate ray-geometry intersection testing

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize acceleration structure updates for dynamic scenes
- Balance between query complexity and rendering performance
