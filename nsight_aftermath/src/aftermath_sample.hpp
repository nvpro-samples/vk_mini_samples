// Simple rasterizer of glTF objects
// - Each OBJ loaded are stored in an `ObjModel` and referenced by a `ObjInstance`
// - It is possible to have many `ObjInstance` referencing the same `ObjModel`
// - Rendering is done in an offscreen framebuffer
// - The image of the framebuffer is displayed in post-process in a full-screen quad
